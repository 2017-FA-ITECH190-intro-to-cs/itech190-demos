    <h1>Sorting Algorithm 2</h1>
    <p>
        The second algorithm is a little more complex, but if we follow it carefully, it's logic will become clear. Again, use one suit from a deck of cards, shuffled (or any other sortable items, really).
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code>
    Create a collection of lines by putting each person in a line.
    Do the following while there is more than one line:
        Create a new line called newLine
        Call the next two lines in the collection line1 and line2
        firstInLine1 = first item in line1
        firstInLine2 = first item in line2
        Do the following until one of line1 and line2 is empty:
            If firstInLine1 comes before firstInLine2:
                add firstInLine1 to newLine
                firstInLine1 = next item from line1
            else:
                add firstInLine2 to newLine
                firstInLine2 = next item in line2
        When one of line1 and line2 is empty,
            Add all of the items from the other line to the end of newLine
        Add newLine to the collection of lines
        </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        By the end, you will have one sorted line of cards.

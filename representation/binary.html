    <h1>Number Representation</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Digital computing is wholly dependent on the fact that a wire either has current or does not. It is either on or off. It has binary state. Thus, everything in a computer has a binary representation. Indeed, in the early days of computing there were many attempts to build computers that could handle multiple voltage levels, thereby creating a non-binary system. In the end, binary was just easier. And now, we have ways of <strong>representating</strong> just about any kind of data you can think of, from numbers and text to images, sound, and video. Let's look at some of the basic ways in which numbers can be represented.

        <h2>Binary</h2>
        <p>
            The decimal system is familiar to us all. It's based on the number 10, and there are 10 numerals used to represent any number imaginable. Any time you reach a power of 10, you simply add another digit. For example, the number 125 in base 10 can be broken down in decimal notation like this:
        </p>
        <p style="align:center;">
            125<sub>10</sub> = 1*100 + 2*10 + 5*1 = 1*10<sup>2</sup> + 2*10<sup>1</sup> + 5*10<sup>0</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice, that we can represent each place value as an integer from 0 to 9 multiplied by some power of 10.
        </p>
        <p>
            In binary, we can actually represent numbers in much the same way, as integers from 0 to 1 multiplied by powers of 2. How does this work in practice? Well, we know the powers of 10 pretty easily. They are, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. The powers of 2 might also be fairly familiar, especially if you've spent much time with computers:
        </p>

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Power of 2</th> <th>Value</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>0</sup></td> <td>1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>1</sup></td><td>2</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>2</sup></td><td>4</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>3</sup></td><td>8</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>4</sup></td><td>16</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>5</sup></td><td>32</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>6</sup></td><td>64</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>7</sup></td><td>128</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>2<sup>8</sup></td><td>256</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            Thus, a number like 86 will be easily represented in base 10 like this:
        </p>
        <p style="align:center">
            86<sub>10</sub> = 8*10<sup>1</sup> + 6*10<sup>0</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            To represent it in base 2, binary, is a little trickier:
        </p>
        <p style="align:center">
            86<sub>10</sub> = 1*2<sup>6</sup> + 0*2<sup>5</sup> + 1*2<sup>4</sup> + 0*2<sup>3</sup> + 1*2<sup>2</sup> + 1*2<sup>1</sup> + 0*2<sup>0</sup><br />
            or<br/>
            86<sub>10</sub> = 1010110<sub>2</sub>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> subscript 2 represents a binary number. Each binary digit is called a bit. And 1010110 is represented by 7 bits. Any positive integer can be be broken down in this way. The tricky part is just remembering all of your powers of 2.
        </p>

        <h2>Arithmetic: Addition in binary</h2>
        <p>
            Arithmetic in binary is really quite simple. You simply set up a problem as you would a decimal arithmetic problem and then follow three rules:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>0+0=0, no carry</li>
            <li>1+0=1, no carry</li>
            <li>0+1=1, no carry</li>
            <li>1+1-0, carry a 1</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Let's look at a simple 4-bit addition. Adding 5<sub>10</sub> to 9<sub>10</sub>. First, we convert to binary. 5<sub>10</sub> = 0101<sub>2</sub> and 9<sub>10</sub> = 1001. We set up the problem exaclty as we would in binary arithmetic and then add following our rules, from right to left.
        </p>
        <p>
            <pre>
               1   <em>carries</em>
             0101
            <u>+1001</u>
             1110
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pay special attention to the carry in the "2s" column. Now, this is all well and good, of course, and it is definitely how computers do these sorts of computations. However, can you see any problems with this way of dealing with numbers? Remember, ones and zeroes are <em>all</em> a digital computer has to work with...

        <h2>Negative Numbers and Ones' Complement</h2>
        <p>
            A computer can <em>only</em> represent numbers as ones and zeroes. Thus, we need some method of representing negative numbers using <em>only</em> ones and zeros.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first, and simplest method of negating a number is a system called "ones' complement". The method is quite simple. To represent a negative number, all you need to do is flip all of the bits in the number. So, the 8-bit number 0101 1100 becomes 1010 0011. The only problem is, the two numbers look remarkably similar. So, how do we signify that the second number is a negative? We reserve the most significant bit as our sign. It if it's a 0, the number is positive. If it's a 1, then the number is negative. In this way, we can only use the last 7 bits of the number to represent an 8-bit number. The leftmost bit is the "sign" of the number. To see this in action, examine the following table closely (shamlessly ripped off from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ones%27_complement">Wikipedia</a>)
        </p>
        <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Bits</th>
    <th>Unisgned Value</th>
    <th>One's Complement</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0111 1111</td>
    <td>127</td>
    <td>127</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0111 1110</td>
    <td>126</td>
    <td>126</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0000 0010</td>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0000 0001</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0000 0000</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1111 1111</td>
    <td>255</td>
    <td>-0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1111 1110</td>
    <td>254</td>
    <td>-1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1111 1101</td>
    <td>253</td>
    <td>-1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1000 0001</td>
    <td>129</td>
    <td>-126</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1000 0000</td>
    <td>128</td>
    <td>-127</td>
  </tr>

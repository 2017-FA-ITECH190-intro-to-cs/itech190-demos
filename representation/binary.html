        <h2>Introduction</h2>

            Digital computing is wholly dependent on the fact that a wire either has current or does not. It is either on or off. It has binary state. Thus, everything in a computer has a binary representation. Indeed, in the early days of computing there were many attempts to build computers that could handle multiple voltage levels, thereby creating a non-binary system. In the end, binary was just easier. And now, we have ways of <strong>representating</strong> just about any kind of data you can think of, from numbers and text to images, sound, and video. Let's look at some of the basic ways in which numbers can be represented.

            The decimal system is familiar to us all. It's based on the number 10, and there are 10 numerals used to represent any number imaginable. Any time you reach a power of 10, you simply add another digit. For example, the number 125 in base 10 can be broken down in decimal notation like this:
        </p>
        <p style="align:center;">
            125<sub>10</sub> = 1*100 + 2*10 + 5*1 = 1*10<sup>2</sup> + 2*10<sup>1</sup> + 5*10<sup>0</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice, that we can represent each place value as an integer from 0 to 9 multiplied by some power of 10.
        </p>

            In binary, we can actually represent numbers in much the same way, as integers from 0 to 1 multiplied by powers of 2. How does this work in practice? Well, we know the powers of 10 pretty easily. They are, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, etc. The powers of 2 might also be fairly familiar, especially if you've spent much time with computers:
